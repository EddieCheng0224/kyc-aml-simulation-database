# KYC / AML Simulated Database

This is a simulated KYC/AML database I designed to demonstrate how to perform KYC and AML checks using SQL. This project includes the following:

## Database Structure

- **users**: Stores user data.
- **transactions**: Stores user transaction records.
- **blacklist**: Stores users who need to undergo KYC/AML checks.

## Fake Data

I created the following fake data:

- Users: John Doe (normal user) and Jane Smith (blacklisted).
- Transactions: John has a suspicious transaction flagged.
- Blacklist: Jane Smith's ID is flagged in the blacklist.

## SQL Queries

1. **Check Blacklist Users**:
   Query to check which users are in the blacklist.

2. **Check Suspicious Transactions**:
   Query to flag all transactions greater than $10,000 as suspicious.

3. **Check Abnormal Transactions**:
   Query to check users who perform abnormal transaction activity (more than 5 transactions in a day).

## How to Run

1. Create a new database in your SQL environment.
2. Copy and execute the SQL code to create the tables and insert fake data.
3. Run the SQL queries to detect suspicious transactions and blacklist users.
